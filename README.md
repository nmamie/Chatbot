# Building an Intelligent Conversational Agent (ATAI 2022)

This repository contains the code that was created to build a conversational agent that is able to hold conversations with humans about the topic of movies. It contains the following files:
- Jupyter Notebooks that were used to conduct experiments on the different topics taught in class. The results were (partly) used to implement the final version of the chatbot.
- The agent implementation (Brain, Knowledge, Query, Response and Patterns containing tools for the agent) that is mainly concluded in the movie_agent.py and movie_bot.py files.
- The report section contains the report itself, PNG/PDF files of the class diagram (Project.png/pdf) and my attempt at reducing the knowledge graph to 2 dimensions.
